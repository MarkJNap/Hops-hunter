# Hops Hunter
#### Brewery Finder

---

## Description

The creation of this app is to have a website that a user can easily find and display Brewery locations near any place based on Country, State, City, or Post Code searching as long as it is in our database. We display the listed breweries information and provide a map with a pin marker with more detailed information on the location.
As a group of 4 with Panos, Tesfa, Sam and Mark this app sounded like a cool idea and could be easily expandable to include more details or more databases. Working as a group we have learnt a lot about teamwork, communication and important GitHub and GitBash features that are going to be extremely useful in the workplace.

## Installation / APIs

There is nothing needed to start using the app, simply follow the link and it will run in your browser.
The APIs we are using are the [Open Brewery](https://www.openbrewerydb.org/documentation) and [Google Maps](https://developers.google.com/maps) API.

## Usage 
## *UPDATE BEFORE FINAL RELEASE*

To use this app the user needs to first pick how they would like to search either by selecting Country, State, City, or Post code. When an option is selected and when they type in the search field results are updated in a dropdown list of all our possible breweries that match their input. After they hit the search button the Breweries List in the center is populated with the results and if they click on a result it will open up a map showing its location. At this point they are able to add it to their favourites to be easily searched again and it is saved to local storage to be remembered on refresh. The user is also able to hover over and click the map marker for more detailed information about their selected brewery such as the breweries Website,Phone number, and Street information.
